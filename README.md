# Burp Extension Swagger's JSON parser

## Discription:
Swagger's JSON parser is used as an extension for BurpSuite. It downloads the json from the provided link and prepares the data for the BurpSuite format that will be used to create the Site Map.

## Instructions for use:
The following steps are required to install the application:
1. Download the project: https://github.com/DmytroPetrushenko/Burp_Extension_Swagger_JSON_parser

2. Open BurpSuite, go to **Extensions > Extensions settings > Extensions**, in the **Python environment** section select the file **jython-standalone-2.7.3.jar**. It is located in the folder, named resources, of the loaded project. 
It is very important that the two folders named **"bin"** and **"Lib/site-packages"** remain next to **jython-standalone-2.7.3.jar**, as they contain additional libraries needed for the script. Donâ€™t delete them.
